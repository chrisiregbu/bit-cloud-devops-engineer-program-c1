Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, I have deployed a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

The files included are: 

index.html - The Index document for the website.
/img - The background image file for the website.
/vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function.
/css - CSS files for the website.

steps.docx - screenshots of the results of each of the steps

There are three ways to access the website:

1. By opening a web browser, and copying and pasting the CloudFront domain name: https://dvpnx7jvit2pi.cloudfront.net  

2. By accessing the website via the website endpoint: http://my-471776097205-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

3. By accessing the bucket object via its S3 object URL: https://my-471776097205-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html
